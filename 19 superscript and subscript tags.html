    <p>Octopuses are predominantly found in <sub> the world's oceans, dwelling in a variety of environments </sub>, from shallow coastal waters to the abyssal depths. Their adaptability is remarkable, allowing them to navigate through diverse ecosystems. <sup> The ability to change color and texture serves both as a means of communication and as a camouflage tactic </sup>, enabling the octopus to blend seamlessly with its surroundings and avoid predators.</p>
